# pyASCII

pyASCII is Python script/game launcher that displays in the CLI.

### The story of pyASCII:

One day I was super bored at school. I thought of an idea to make some stupid stuff in python.
The next day during study hall, I opened my Chromebook, went to [GDB Online Debugger](https://www.onlinegdb.com "Online GDB") and wrote some random stuff in Python 3.

I later felt that it would be cool to have a kind of script launcher to list all of this random shit and let a user choose what they wanted to run. I then opened the VSCode.dev web app and got to work, now, here we are.

### Coming Soon:

+ Users are able to add their own scripts to a list of directories, [here](https://www.electra-dev.xyz "This isn't a feature yet!"), that other users would be able download and run with a short command.
+ The actual thing that this was meant for, I mean launching scripts.
